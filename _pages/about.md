This is Cuiling Sun, a senior students at Mount Holyoke College, majoring Computer Science. This website displays my work through this semester, including my design ideas, process and outcomes. This one biggest thing I learned is how to put human's needs first, how to design for human, and how to create user-friendly design. If you are interested in them, please check out the Projects and Posts sections.
